# MLBstrikeouts — notes for Claude

## Bet sizing in ad-hoc sweep/backfill scripts

Use **flat 1u** staking when computing units/ROI in any sweep, A/B, or
backfill analysis script (`scripts/sweep_*.py`, one-off report helpers,
etc.) — matches the live dashboard's actual staking plan (`MLB_PICK_STAKE =
1` in `PythonDashboard/js/mlb-props.js`, picks-only flat 1u, no lean tier).

`scripts/compare_configs_AB.py` predates that staking plan and still uses
2.5u picks / 1.5u leans — leave it as-is unless asked to update it, but
don't copy its sizing convention into new scripts. `scripts/sweep_lineup_blend.py`'s
`units()` defaults to `sz=1.0` for this reason; new sweep scripts should do
the same.

ROI% and win rate are scale-invariant to flat stake size, so this only
affects the raw units figures reported, not which config wins.
